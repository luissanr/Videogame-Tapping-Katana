# Videogame-Tapping-Katana
2D Videogame created by me for my CS50x Final Project.

Tapping Katana is a 2D videogame created with lua and LOVE2D.
It is a 2 player videogame about samurais, the first one to strike wins.

How does it work?
There are 2 vertical rectangles at both sides, and there is a green bar at the center and a white one closer to the green one. When the game starts, the white bar will be moving up and down.

What is the goal?
The goal is to try to hit the green bar with the white bar with keys "s" and "k" for player 1 and 2 respectively. There are 3 attempts each round that accumulates, and the fastest attack is calculated by adding the distances with respect to the green bar of the 3 attempts

The first one to win 3 rounds is the fastest samurai and thus win the battle!

Keys: "enter" or "return": move to the next screen. "s": player 1 attack key. "k": player 2 attack key. "Esc": exit the game.
